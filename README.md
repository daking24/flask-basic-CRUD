A basic flask application which performs CRUD operations

## About Flask

Flask-MicroServices is a simple, lightweight attempt at bringing self contained module hierarchy to Flask. Better project organization through separation of concerns, isolating the different sections of your app into separate modules, or ‘microservices’.

An opinionated, but minimal approach to higher maintainability with Flask.
